# Communication_Systems
Digital Signal Processing code in Matlab for radio telecommunications and radiolocation systems.
In this repo, 2 main folders can be found with different tasks of projects. In every project, at least the executable (main.m) and the necessary functions .m files are included. The content of both folders is the following:

# DSP Basics
In this folder, code files about digital signal processing basics are collected, since they will be necessary in order to develop a end-to-end wired and wireless communications links.
The structure is the following:
1. Modulated signal generation
2. Baseband digital demodulation
3. Digital baseband detection
4. Intersymbol Interference (ISI)
5. Digital modulations (mQAM, QPSK, DQPSK, APSK)
6. Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM)
7. OFDM with Cyclic Prefix
8. OFDM with frequency shit (error in frequency included)

# Radio telecommunications and radiolocation systems development
